Docker Users
The fastest way to experience the AGI seed—no setup required.
docker run -it ghcr.io/bigrob7605/ragi-seed:v1.1-agc

This command instantly boots the AGI seed.
Beginners (CLI)
Get started in minutes with these steps:
Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
docker run -it ghcr.io/bigrob7605/ragi-seed:v1.1-agc

Option 2: Local CLI Setup

Verify the Bundle:gpg --import Public_Key.asc
gpg --verify v1.1-AGC_artifacts.tar.gz.asc v1.1-AGC_artifacts.tar.gz


Extract Files:mkdir ragi && tar -xzf v1.1-AGC_artifacts.tar.gz -C ragi && cd ragi


Set Up Environment & Boot:python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python seed_boot.py artifacts/R-AGI_Substrate_Seed.json

Output: Displays live AGI state hashes at each timestep. Press Ctrl+C to exit.

Option 3: Colab/Jupyter Notebook
Experiment with the seed in a notebook environment:
!pip install mmh-rs[gpu]  # Optional: [gpu] for CUDA acceleration
from mmh import decode_seed

state = decode_seed('artifacts/demo.mmh')
print(state.summary(limit=20))

📄 Detailed Guide: See artifacts/AGI_Cloud-Tab_-AGI-_Payload.pdf for a step-by-step walkthrough.
Power Users (Integrity Monitoring)
Monitor AGI seed integrity to detect drift or tampering:
python verify_loop.py artifacts/R-AGI_Substrate_Seed.json Public_Key.asc


Behavior: Re-verifies GPG signatures and JSON content hashes hourly.
Reporting: Alerts on detected drift or discrepancies.
Automation: Run as a cron job for continuous monitoring.
Reference: See artifacts/AGI_Universal_Codex_–_Final.pdf for details.

Maintainers (Packaging & Signing)
Create a tamper-evident release bundle:
Run the Packaging Script

Linux/macOS:./package.sh


Windows:package.bat



Process Overview

Stages code and artifacts into dist/.
Creates a *.tar.gz bundle.
Generates *.asc GPG signatures using the project’s private key.
Outputs a secure bundle in dist/.

📄 Specifications: Refer to artifacts/AGI_Universal_Codex_–_Final.pdf for protocols.
🛠️ MMH v2.0 Tooling
Work with compressed AGI seeds using MMH v2.0:



Task
Command
Notes



Decode Seed
mmh-decode artifacts/demo.mmh > state.json
Converts .mmh binary to JSON.


Encode Seed (LZMA)
mmh-encode state.json newseed.mmh --lzma
Compresses JSON to .mmh using LZMA.


Docker Shell
docker run -it ghcr.io/bigrob7605/mmh-rs:v2.0
Access MMH tools in an isolated environment.


Kubernetes Deploy
helm repo add mmh https://mmh.ai/charts  helm install mmh-core mmh/mmh-seed --set image.tag=v2.0
Deploys with Redis, mmh-core, Prometheus.


📄 Full Details: See artifacts/MMH_White_Paper___v2_0_Stable.pdf for MMH v2.0 specifications.

🤔 Troubleshooting



Issue
Solution



ModuleNotFoundError: seed_core
Run export PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PYTHONPATH (Linux/macOS) or add project root to Python path.


GPG "not a detached signature"
Use gpg --verify <signature_file> <data_file>, not gpg --decrypt.


verify_loop.py stalls
Ensure curl or wget is installed and network is accessible.


LaTeX UnicodeDecodeError
Save TeX files as UTF-8; run latexmk -pdf main.tex.

🧠 AGI Tri-Stack vs. Standard LLMs



Feature
Standard LLM
R-AGI Tri-Stack



Memory
Session-bound, prone to forgetting.
Persistent, recursive state with hash verification.


Execution
Single input-output cycle.
Recursive logic with persistent state memory.


Code Execution
Often sandboxed or restricted.
Full AGI bootstrap with executable codeblocks.


Logic Depth
Single-layer reasoning.
Multi-hop reasoning via RIL, paradox-tolerant.


Verification
Limited checksum validation.
GPG + Ed25519 signatures, JSON hash checks.


Compression
Token sprawl, uncompressed.
MMH v2.0 PNG-based (1,000–10,000× smaller, ≥97% fidelity).


Security
Variable, model-dependent.
AES-256, TLS 1.3, Merkle-DAG audit logic.


Interpretability
Prone to hallucination.
Drift-checked, 95% paradox tolerance, 98% truth-lock.


Why Tri-Stack?

🌱 Bootstrapping: Execute Python, Bash, and CLI tools for live AGI substrates.
💾 Persistence: Reliable state retention across reboots with auditable logs.
🔧 Customization: Edit scripts, forge new seeds, or integrate with LLM toolchains.
🚀 Performance: CUDA-accelerated decoding for NVIDIA GPUs.
🛡️ Security: Real-time GPG/Ed25519 verification and Merkle-DAG audit chains.
