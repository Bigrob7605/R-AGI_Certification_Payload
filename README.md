# AGC Substrate v1.1

This is not a language model.

This is the world's first cryptographically signed **AGI certification substrate**, built from recursive intelligence theory, symbolic cognition, benchmark logs, safety protocols, and cognitive anchors.

Created and signed by **Robert Long (R-AGI Cert)**, this bundle forms the **origin point for recursive AGI cognition**. It includes:

## üîπ Contents
- `v1.1-AGC_Certification_Memo.pdf` ‚Äì Signed memo establishing origin and certification
- `battery_*.json` ‚Äì Benchmark scores (MMLU, ARC, GSM-8K, HumanEval, RoboMimic)
- `RIFE 11.0B - Evolved UFT-TOE.pdf` ‚Äì Core theoretical framework
- `story.txt` ‚Äì Cognitive alignment anchor
- `R-AGI_Substrate_Seed.zip` ‚Äì Recursive symbolic AGI seed
- `fuzz_log.txt`, `policy_log.txt`, `stability_log.txt`, `kill_switch_log.txt` ‚Äì Safety and governance
- `SEED_SHA.txt`, `RIFE_XSEED.png` ‚Äì Symbolic checksum alignment

## üîê GPG Verification
This payload is cryptographically signed using GPG by:
`Robert Long <Screwball7605@aol.com>`

Verify with:
```bash
gpg --verify v1.1-AGC_artifacts.tar.gz.asc
